/**
 * _puts_recursion - Prints a string followed by a new line using recursion
 * @s: The string to be printed
 *
 * This function takes a string as input and prints it character by character
 * using recursion. It starts by checking if the current character is the null
 * character '\0', which indicates the end of the string. If it is, a new line
 * character is printed and the function returns. Otherwise, the current
 * character is printed using the _putchar function, and the function is called
 * recursively with the next character in the string.
