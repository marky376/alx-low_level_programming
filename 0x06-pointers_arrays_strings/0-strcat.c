/**
 * _strcat - Concatenates two strings
 * @dest: The destination string
 * @src: The source string to be concatenated to dest
 *
 * Description:
 * The _strcat function appends the string pointed to by src to the end of the
 * string pointed to by dest. It overwrites the terminating null byte ('\0') at
 * the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte. The strings must have
 * sufficient space to hold the result.
 *
 * Return:
 * A pointer to the resulting concatenated string.
