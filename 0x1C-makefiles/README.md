## Introduction
Welcome to the README file for Makefiles! In this document, we will explore the concept of Makefiles and their importance in software development.

## What is a Makefile?
A Makefile is a text file that contains a set of instructions (rules) for building and managing software projects. It is commonly used in Unix-based systems to automate the compilation and linking process of source code files.

## Why use Makefiles?
Makefiles provide a way to automate the build process, making it easier to compile and manage complex software projects. They help in organizing dependencies, tracking changes, and executing build commands efficiently.

## How does a Makefile work?
A Makefile consists of rules that define how to build specific targets (e.g., executable files, object files). Each rule consists of a target, dependencies, and commands. When a target is requested, Make checks if any of its dependencies have changed and executes the associated commands to build the target.

## Writing a Makefile
To write a Makefile, you need to define rules for each target and specify the dependencies and commands. The syntax of a rule is as follows:

```make
