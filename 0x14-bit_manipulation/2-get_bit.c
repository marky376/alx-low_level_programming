/**
 * get_bit - function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
 * @n: the unsigned long integer to be used
 * @index: index to iterate all through the integer
 *
 * Description:
 * This function takes an unsigned long integer 'n' and an index, and returns
 * the value of the bit at the given index. The index represents the position
 * of the bit, starting from 0 as the least significant bit.
 *
 * Return:
 * The function returns the value of the bit at the given index. If the index
 * is out of range (greater than or equal to the number of bits in an unsigned
 * long integer), the function returns -1.
