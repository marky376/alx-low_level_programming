/**
 * set_bit - function that sets a bit to one at a given index
 * @n: the pointer to indicate the given integer
 * @index: an index to iterate through the long integer
 *
 * Description:
 * This function sets the bit at the specified index to 1 in the given integer.
 * It uses bitwise operations to perform the task.
 *
 * Return:
 * -1 if the index is out of range (greater than or equal to the number of bits in unsigned long int)
 * 1 if the bit is successfully set to 1
