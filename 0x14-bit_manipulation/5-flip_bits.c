/**
 * flip_bits - function that determines how many numbers
 * are required to be flipped to form another binary number
 * @n: the long integer to be used as case 1
 * @m: the long integer to be used as case 2
 *
 * This function takes two long integers, n and m, and calculates
 * the number of bits that need to be flipped in order to transform
 * n into m. It performs a bitwise XOR operation between n and m
 * to obtain a number with set bits at the positions where the bits
 * in n and m differ. Then, it counts the number of set bits in the
 * result using a bitwise AND operation and right shift. The final
 * count is returned as the result.
 *
 * Return: the number of bits to be flipped
